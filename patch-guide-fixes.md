# PatchGuide Fixes - June 2025

## Fixed Issues:

### 1. MIDI Stop Button Issue
- Fixed a bug where stopping MIDI playback would prevent any further playback
- Added AudioContext resumption to ensure context isn't suspended after stopping
- Increased timeout after stopping playback to ensure clean restart (50ms â†’ 100ms)

### 2. Added Drum/Percussion Section to PatchGuide
- Added a new section "Rhythm & Percussion Integration" to the patch guide
- This section prompts the AI to suggest:
  - Complementary kick/snare character for the synth sound
  - Hi-hat/cymbal patterns that work well with the sound
  - Additional percussion elements that enhance the synth patch

## Implementation Details:

1. **AudioService.ts Changes**:
   - Modified `stopPlayback()` to ensure AudioContext is resumed
   - This prevents the context from getting stuck in a suspended state

2. **PatchGuideServiceOptimized.ts Changes**:
   - Added new "Rhythm & Percussion Integration" section to the prompt template
   - This ensures drum/percussion advice is included in all patch guides

3. **MidiGeneratorComponent.tsx Changes**:
   - Increased timeout after stopping playback to ensure clean restart

These changes ensure that:
1. MIDI playback can be stopped and restarted properly
2. Patch guides include relevant information about percussion that complements the synth sound
